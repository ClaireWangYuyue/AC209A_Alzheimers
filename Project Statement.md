# Goal of the Project

Alzheimer’s Disease is a common form of dementia that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. In the
United States, more than 5 million people aged 65 and over suffer from the disease. The estimated national cost
of patient care for Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia was $236 billion in 2016. Specifically, the cost of
brain imagings such as PET and MRI in the process of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) diagnosis is very expensive.
So we want to determine the effectiveness of different testing methods so that AD patients can be relatively
accurately diagnosed with as few number of tests as possible. In other words, for this project, we aim to
determine the performance of different testing methods for AD, and find out the most significant groups of
predictors in predicting the diagnosis for patients.

Furthermore, we would like to take one step further and investigate whether certain AD testing method is more
accurate for a certain group of patient (e.g. White male older than 75) in diagnosing AD. To do that, we will
conduct statistically testings between groups of patients with shared characteristics on the performance of
different testing methods. If some patterns are found, doctors can be even more efficient in diagnosing patients
of various background.

So the objective of this project is to build a data-driven model for Alzheimer’s Disease using patient
demographic information, medical records, brain imaging data and other related data to predict the diagnosis of
patients, particularly focusing on the problem discussed above. We will first investigate through common topics
including finding the major causes of Alzheimer’s and evaluating the risk based on predictors. Then our main
goal is to perform several advanced analysis on the dataset trying to answer the questions we raised above.
